# e-Lawyer

React Native marketplace for paid legal consultations. The app has two roles in one binary:

- `CLIENT`: browse legal categories, filter lawyers, book and pay, view appointments, leave gated reviews.
- `LAWYER`: create a profile, manage price/categories/availability, see paid client bookings and contact details, manage schedule and reviews.

The backend is FastAPI + PostgreSQL. Payments are pluggable through provider adapters (`mock`, `stripe`, `qpay`) so local development works immediately and production gateways can be added without rewriting the booking flow.

## Backend Setup

For the one-command local stack, use:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

That command starts PostgreSQL with Docker Compose, creates `backend/.env` if missing, prepares the backend virtualenv, runs migrations, seeds categories, starts FastAPI, and starts Expo.

To launch a platform immediately:

```bash
npm run dev:ios
npm run dev:android
npm run dev:web
```

If a previous run is still occupying ports:

```bash
npm run dev:stop
```

If your default shell uses Node 24, the script will try to run Expo through a compatible Node 20 binary (`node20`, Homebrew `node@20`, or `npx node@20`) while leaving your global Node untouched.

You can override ports:

```bash
API_PORT=8000 EXPO_PORT=8081 npm run dev:all
```

If Docker Desktop is slow to start:

```bash
DOCKER_WAIT_SECONDS=180 npm run dev:all
```

Manual setup:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
cd ..
docker compose up -d postgres
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
alembic upgrade head
python -m app.scripts.seed_categories
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

API docs run at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Mobile Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run ios
```

For Android emulator, set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000/api`. For a physical device, use your machine's LAN IP.

## Core API Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/register` creates a `CLIENT` or `LAWYER`, hashes password, returns JWT and a dev OTP.
- `POST /api/auth/login` returns JWT.
- `POST /api/auth/otp/request` and `/api/auth/otp/verify` manage phone OTP verification.
- `GET /api/categories` returns seeded legal categories with English and Mongolian labels.
- `GET /api/lawyers` supports category, search, rating, price, and sort filters.
- `PUT /api/lawyers/me/profile` lets lawyers manage bio, categories, availability, credentials, and price.
- `POST /api/payments/checkout` creates a pending appointment/payment hold.
- `POST /api/payments/{id}/confirm` verifies payment, confirms appointment, and notifies the lawyer.
- `GET /api/chats/appointments/{appointment_id}` opens the paid appointment chat for the client/lawyer.
- `GET /api/chats/appointments/{appointment_id}/rtm-token` returns a short-lived Agora RTM token for that paid appointment participant.
- `POST /api/chats/{thread_id}/messages` sends a chat message inside a paid appointment thread.
- `GET /api/chats/agora/config` returns non-secret Agora chat config when `CHAT_PROVIDER=agora`.
- `GET /api/appointments` returns role-filtered appointments. Lawyers receive paid client contact snapshots.
- `PATCH /api/appointments/{id}` lets lawyers/admins complete or cancel appointments.
- `POST /api/reviews` allows one review only for the paying client on a paid completed appointment.
- `GET /api/admin/reviews` and `PATCH /api/reviews/{id}/moderation` support basic review moderation.

## Seeded Legal Categories

The seed script creates:

1. Civil Law
2. Criminal Defense
3. Administrative Law
4. Business / Corporate Law
5. Family Law
6. Labor Law

Each stores `name` and `description` as JSON i18n maps (`en`, `mn`).

## Key Decisions

- FastAPI + PostgreSQL fits your Python preference and keeps authorization/payment rules server-side.
- JWT is used for API auth; passwords are stored with bcrypt via Passlib.
- OTP is modeled in SQL with hashed codes. The development response includes `dev_otp_code`; production should wire the same service to an SMS provider.
- Appointments are only confirmed after `PaymentStatus.SUCCEEDED`.
- Reviews are gated by server checks: same client, paid payment, completed appointment, one review per appointment.
- Lawyer contact details are not exposed in public profiles. Lawyers see the paying client's phone/email only through their appointment contact snapshot.
- Paid appointments create a private chat thread. If the lawyer has set an auto-response message in profile settings, it is sent automatically after payment confirmation with the lawyer's contact line appended.
- Push notification delivery is isolated in `NotificationService`; plug Expo Push or FCM there.

## Chat and Agora

The current chat implementation is server-authorized and stored in PostgreSQL so development works immediately. It creates one chat thread per paid appointment, gates access to the paying client and booked lawyer, and inserts the lawyer's saved auto-response after payment.

When `CHAT_PROVIDER=agora`, the backend also mints short-lived Agora RTM tokens from the App ID/App Certificate. The app attempts to use Agora RTM where the JavaScript RTM SDK is supported, then keeps PostgreSQL as message history and audit storage. Expo Go native builds use the server-backed chat fallback; native realtime RTM should be added through a development build/native SDK phase if required.

Agora is scaffolded as a pluggable provider. Add these values to `backend/.env` when you want me to wire the Agora SDK transport:

- `CHAT_PROVIDER=agora`
- `AGORA_APP_ID`
- `AGORA_PROJECT_ID`
- `AGORA_PROJECT_NAME`
- `AGORA_REGION`
- `AGORA_ENABLED_FEATURES`
- `AGORA_FEATURE_RTM=true`
- `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` if token authentication is enabled
- `AGORA_CUSTOMER_ID`
- `AGORA_CUSTOMER_SECRET`

Also tell me whether you want Agora Chat only, or Chat plus voice/video calling in the same phase.

## Payment Providers

Set `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock`, `stripe`, or `qpay`.

- `mock`: local dev, confirms immediately when `mock_success=true`.
- `stripe`: adapter stub expects `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`; add PaymentIntent create/retrieve calls.
- `qpay`: adapter stub expects `QPAY_USERNAME` and `QPAY_PASSWORD`; add invoice create/status calls.

## Production Notes

- Replace `JWT_SECRET` and `OTP_PEPPER` with long random values.
- Add real SMS, push notification, object storage, and gateway credentials.
- Run Alembic migrations in deployment.
- Add audit logging around payment webhooks, appointment status changes, and admin review moderation.
- Add CI steps: backend lint/test, mobile typecheck, and API contract tests.
